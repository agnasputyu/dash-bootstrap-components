## What is PacQuest 3D?
 
PacQuest 3D is a 3D arcade game that follows the adventures of Pacman, a yellow sphere with a mouth that eats dots and fruits while avoiding ghosts. The game is inspired by the classic Pac-Man game from the 1980s, but with a twist: instead of playing on a flat maze, you can explore a 3D world with hills, valleys, bridges, and tunnels. You can also collect power-ups that give you special abilities, such as speed boost, invincibility, or extra lives.
 
PacQuest 3D has four different worlds to explore: Forest World, Ancient World, Ice World, and Lava World. Each world has its own theme, music, and challenges. You can also choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The game has a total of 16 levels to complete, plus a bonus level that unlocks after you finish the game.
